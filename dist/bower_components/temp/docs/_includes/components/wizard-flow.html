	<p>Wizards refer to multi-step operations that consist of several pages gone through one by one. Wizard should be used when the operation or functionality includes multiple logical steps that need to be walked through step by step.</p>

	<p><b>Usage</b></p>
	
	<p>Use the wizard element if the steps depend on each other (a certain screen affects the next screens) or if there are multiple mandatory but independent steps (the order is not important but going through a number of screens is).</p>

	<p>Wizards must not be used if the steps are optional. Tabs, for example, could be used instead.</p>

	<p><b>Rules and recommendations</b></p>

	<p>The steps of the wizard are presented with a step indicator showing the order and emphasizing the current step.</p>
	<p>When there are too many steps for presenting all of them at once, a version with the number of total steps, number of the current step and title of the current page should be used instead.</p>
